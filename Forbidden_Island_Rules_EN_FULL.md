- You can capture treasures **even on flooded tiles** (not sunken ones).

---

## 🎴 Phase 2 — Draw 2 Treasure Cards

Draw 2 cards **one at a time**. Reveal and place them face-up in front of you.

If you draw a **Waters Rise!**, follow the steps below.

### 🔥 Treasure Card Types

- **Artifact Cards** (needed to capture artifacts)
- **Special Action Cards**:
  - **Helicopter Lift**: Move any number of players from one tile to another.
  - **Sandbags**: Instantly shore up any one tile (no action required).

You may use Special Action cards at any time, even during another player’s turn.

### ⚠️ Waters Rise! Card

1. Move the water level marker up one tick.
2. Shuffle the Flood discard pile and place it **on top** of the Flood deck.
3. Discard the *Waters Rise!* card.

Notes:
- If you draw 2 *Waters Rise!* cards, move the water level up 2 steps and shuffle only once.
- Do **not** replace *Waters Rise!* with new cards.

### 🧺 Hand Limit

You can hold **up to 5 Treasure cards** (including specials).  
If you go over, immediately discard cards down to 5.  
You may use a special card **before** discarding it.

---

## 🌊 Phase 3 — Draw Flood Cards

Draw a number of Flood cards **based on the water level**.

For each card:
- If the tile is **normal**, flip it to the flooded side.
- If it is already **flooded**, remove it permanently from the game (along with the Flood card).

### 🧍 Pawns on Flooded Tiles

- If a tile floods with a pawn on it, the pawn stays.
- If a tile sinks with a pawn on it:
  - The player must immediately move to an adjacent tile (even if flooded).
  - If no adjacent tile is available: 💀 Game over!

**Special abilities:**
- **Diver**: Can “swim” to the next available tile.
- **Pilot**: Can fly to safety.
- **Explorer**: Can escape diagonally.
